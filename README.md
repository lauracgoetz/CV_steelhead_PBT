# California Central Valley Hatchery steelhead broodstock SNP parentage, 2011-2019

[Access this dataset on Dryad](10.5702/qlm.1266rr)

This dataset contains the metadata and SNP genotypes for the steelhead sampled at the four California Central Valley (CCV) from 2011-2019. 

We reconstructed pedigrees, conducted population genetic analyses, analyzed life history characteristics (age at spawning, iteroparity, timing of spawning), and considered Omy05 genotype and phenotype. 

We found steelhead from different genetic lineages showed significant differences in adult life history traits despite inhabiting similar environments. Differences between coastal and Central Valley steelhead lineages contributed to significant differences in age at return, timing of spawning, and rates of iteroparity amongst programs. In addition, adaptive genomic variation associated with life history development in this species varied among hatchery programs and was associated with age of steelhead spawners only in the coastal lineage population.


## Description of the data and file structure

Unprocessed metadata and genotypes (cvsh.csv and cvsh.rds) are included in the metadata/ directory.  Omy05 genotypes are in a separate file within this directory as well. SNPs are in two-column format (one column per allele). 

Reproducible R scripts to process these data for the analyses featured in the manuscript are included in the scripts/ directory. These scripts are numbered in chronological order for these analyses, and include downloads for necessary packages. 

Tables cited in the manuscript are in the tables/ directory, and figures cited in the manuscript are in the final_figures/ directory.

The additional/ directory includes some shapefiles used to generate Figure 1. Download information for these shapefiles is provided in the map figure script (7_map.Rmd). The final version of Figure 1 was compiled using Adobe Illustrator.
